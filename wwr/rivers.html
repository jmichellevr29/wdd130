                <h2 class="title">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p class="pargh">Nestled in the heart of the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return, the Salmon River, affectionately called the "River of No Return," beckons with its rugged beauty. 
                Surrounded by elk, deer, bears, and bighorn sheep, and framed by towering ponderosa pines, this undammed river boasts rapids ranging from class I to IV.</p>
                <p class="pargh">As one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States, the Salmon offers a dynamic experience. Early summer brings higher, faster, and colder waters, 
                perfect for thrill-seekers. Late summer, on the other hand, slows the pace, creating warmer currents ideal for families with children who love to swim. 
                Join us on the Salmon Riverâ€”an ever-changing canvas of natural splendor, inviting you to explore its enchanting chapters.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p class="pargh">As the grand daddy of all canyons and river trips, a visit to the Grand Canyon is an unforgettable experience. Grand Canyon river rafting seamlessly blends world-class whitewater excitement with awe-inspiring scenery, 
                creating a truly unparalleled adventure. The canyon not only features exhilarating rapids ranging from Class I to X but also unveils side canyons and ancient Indian ruins, accessible solely by river.</p>
                <p class="pargh">The Grand Canyon boasts a distinctive river rating scale, ranging from I to X (1 to 10), accommodating the diverse rapids and river variations within its majestic depths. While this scale is unique, many are more familiar with the traditional I - V river rating, 
                and we often refer to both, ensuring that all adventurers can gauge the thrill that awaits in this iconic natural wonder. Embark on a Grand Canyon river journey, where the fusion of whitewater excitement and breathtaking landscapes creates memories that last a lifetime.</p>
