    <h2>Jennifer Michelle Villacis</h2>
    <p>Hi! Mi name is Michelle Villacis. I'm 23 years old and I grew up in Quito, Ecuador but I currently live in Portoviejo, Ecuador. Fun fact about me is that I was born on a leap day!
        My family isn't too big; just me and my mom. I have an older brother, but he already married.</p>
    <p>Last year, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Medical Laboratory Science. Recently, I've been intrested in Bioinformatics and it's application in DNA 
        sequencing. So hopefully, I can achieve the goal in working on that field in the future.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include; reading, binge watching Netflix series, baking and listening music. My favorite artist is Taylor Swift, recently I had the opportunity to 
        see her live at the Eras Tour. I have two cats that bring me so much joy: Claire, an orange tabby cat and Tilly, a tortoiseshell cat. I have 
        a niece and a nephew that I adore.</p>
    <p>I work as a high school substitute teacher. I started studying in BYU Pathway to gain new knowledge and reinforce my testimony but now, I'm motivated to get 
        another degree and work in a new field. I am excited to learn about web development and hope to do my best in this class.</p>
