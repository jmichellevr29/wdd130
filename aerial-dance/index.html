                <h2>What is Aerial Dance?</h2>
                <p>First of all, aerial dance, also known as aerial dancing or aerial performance, is a form of performing art that combines elements of dance and acrobatics while utilizing various aerial apparatuses, such as aerial silks, aerial hoops (also known as lyra), trapezes, and other aerial type of apparatuses.
                    As any other type of art, we can also express emotions and stories through fluid and expressive movement. We use the aerial equipment to execute various maneuvers like spins, drops, and different types of poses. This combination of dance and aerial techniques creates something visually captivating and dynamic.
                    Even though, this form of art is mesmerizing and fun, we need to remind that classes must be taken with a professional and in safe environments. Aerial dancers, require (mostly) strength, flexibility but the most important is body awareness, to know when it is ok to continue or to stop. 
                    We are going to talk about two different types of apparatuses; first, silks and second, lyra.

                    <h2>Aerial Silks</h2>
                    <p>Is a type of performing art and athletic discipline that involves acrobatics and dance while suspended from two long pieces of fabric, typically made of silk or a similar fabric material. Aerial silks performances are often seen in circuses, as well as in contemporary dance and aerial arts productions.
                        With this type of apparatus we climb, wrap, and drop from the fabric, creating a visually stunning and dynamic display of strength, flexibility, and grace. This requires a combination of physical fitness, balance, coordination, and artistic expression.</p>
                    <p>Aerial silks training can be physically demanding, and practitioners need to build strength, endurance, and flexibility to perform safely. It's important to train under the guidance of experienced instructors and use proper safety equipment, such as crash mats and rigging equipment, to minimize the risk of injury.

                    <h2>Aerial Hoop (Lyra)</h2>
                    <p>The aerial hoop, known as a "lyra" in the world of aerial arts, is a mesmerizing apparatus that brings together elements of acrobatics and dance. This circular or hoop-shaped metal structure, suspended from a secure rigging point, serves as a captivating canvas for aerial artists to showcase their talent. Whether in the realms of circus or contemporary dance, the lyra offers a unique platform for artistic expression.</p>
                    <p>The lyra is a beloved and versatile apparatus in the realm of aerial arts. It offers an expansive platform for artists to tell stories and express their emotions through movements that seem to defy gravity. Just as in other aerial disciplines, proper training and safety precautions are vital for anyone aspiring to practice or perform on the lyra.
